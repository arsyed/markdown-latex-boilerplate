Bullard: “Many of our current environmental policies exist to manage, regulate,
and distribute risks. As a result, the dominant environmental protection
paradigm (1) institutionalizes unequal enforcement; (2) trades human health for
profit; (3) places the burden of proof on the “victims,” not on the polluting
industry; (4) legitimates human exposure to harmful chemicals, pesticides, and
hazardous substances; (5) promotes risky technologies, such as incinerators; (6)
exploits the vulnerability of economically and politically disenfranchised
communities; (7) subsidizes ecological destruction; (8) creates an industry
around risk assessment; (9) delays cleanup actions; and (10) fails to develop
pollution prevention as the overarching and dominant
strategy.”[@bullard_unequal_1994, p. xvi]
